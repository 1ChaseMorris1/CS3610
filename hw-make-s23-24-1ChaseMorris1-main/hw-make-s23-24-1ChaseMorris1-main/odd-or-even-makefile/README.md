# Odd or Even - The Makefile Edition

Implement the recipes of the target named `ItIsSurelyOdd` in the given Makefile. This target should output the word `odd`
when the number of files in the folder `data` is odd. Otherwise `even` should be output.

## Example Test Cases

### Test Case 1

When `Makefile` is in `testcases/1/` folder, running `make` results in this output

```console
$ make
even
```

### Test Case 2

When `Makefile` is in `testcases/2/` folder, running `make` results in this output

```console
$ make
odd
```
